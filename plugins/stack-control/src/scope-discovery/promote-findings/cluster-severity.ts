/**
 * plugins/stack-control/src/scope-discovery/promote-findings/cluster-severity.ts
 *
 * specs/015-audit-protocol-convergence — Phase 3 / US1 (T007).
 *
 * Cross-lane severity-agreement computation (FR-001 mechanism A / D1). Replaces
 * the retired max-of-cluster rule in `extract-barrage-findings.ts:mergeCluster`.
 * Pure — no I/O. contracts/cluster-severity.md is the authority.
 *
 * The retired rule took the MAX severity any single lane assigned, so one lane's
 * HIGH on a finding the rest of the fleet rated MEDIUM inflated the whole cluster
 * to HIGH and the dampener's two-consecutive-raw-0-HIGH branch could never
 * engage (the 014 plateau). The agreement rule counts a cluster at a level only
 * when ≥2 covering lanes rate it at-or-above that level — so [high, medium]
 * de-inflates to MEDIUM while [high, high] stays HIGH and blocks (SC-003).
 *
 * `SEVERITY_RANK` lives here (the leaf of the severity-computation module graph)
 * and is imported by `extract-barrage-findings.ts`, so there is no runtime import
 * cycle: this module's only import from `extract-barrage-findings.ts` is the
 * type-only `NormalizedSeverity` (erased at compile time).
 *
 * The agreement rule's WIDE-spread case (e.g. [high, informational] → informational,
 * an unbounded LOWERING) is bounded downstream in `mergeCluster`, not here: a
 * cluster whose dominant lane is ≥2 levels above the agreement floor is routed
 * through `adjudicate` rather than accepting the floor (AUDIT-20260612-02 /
 * contracts/cluster-severity.md § Disagreement floor). This function stays pure —
 * it computes the floor; the routing decision needs the finding body.
