## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
**Deliverable:** Operator-side annotation of captured screenshots before attaching: arrow, box, freehand, text-label, blur-region tools. Markup persists as `<comment-id>-<timestamp>-marked.png` alongside the raw capture; comment annotation's `attachments[]` references the marked file with `originalAttachment` linking back to the raw.

### Task 12.1: Canvas-overlay markup editor

- [ ] Step 12.1.1: Implement the markup editor per Phase 9's picked design: HTML5 canvas overlay invoked from the capture flow.
- [ ] Step 12.1.2: Loads the raw captured screenshot as the canvas base layer; markup draws on a second canvas layer.
- [ ] Step 12.1.3: Touch + mouse + stylus input all supported (per Phase 9 mobile-aware requirement).

### Task 12.2: Markup tool palette

- [ ] Step 12.2.1: **Arrow** tool: click-drag to draw an arrow from start to end; configurable head size + color.
- [ ] Step 12.2.2: **Box** tool: click-drag to draw a rectangle; outline or filled with operator-selected opacity.
- [ ] Step 12.2.3: **Freehand** tool: drag to draw a freehand line; smoothing algorithm reduces jitter.
- [ ] Step 12.2.4: **Text-label** tool: click to place text input; operator types label; configurable font size + color.
- [ ] Step 12.2.5: **Blur-region** tool: click-drag rectangle; the region is gaussian-blurred (canvas filter) — for sensitive content.
- [ ] Step 12.2.6: Undo / redo stack covering all tools.

### Task 12.3: Save + persistence

- [ ] Step 12.3.1: "Save markup" exports the composed canvas (base + markup) as PNG to `<entryDir>/scrapbook/screenshots/<comment-id>-<timestamp>-marked.png`.
- [ ] Step 12.3.2: The raw capture stays at `<comment-id>-<timestamp>.png` (untouched).
- [ ] Step 12.3.3: Comment annotation's `attachments[]` array updated to reference the marked file path.
- [ ] Step 12.3.4: Attachment metadata gains `originalAttachment: <raw-file-path>` so the operator can re-mark the raw or compare versions.

### Task 12.4: Studio rendering of marked attachments

- [ ] Step 12.4.1: Comment renders the marked version by default with a small "original" toggle in the chrome.
- [ ] Step 12.4.2: Clicking the marked version opens a full-size lightbox; clicking the toggle in the lightbox swaps to raw.

### Task 12.5: Re-mark workflow

- [ ] Step 12.5.1: Operator can re-mark an existing screenshot: opens the markup editor pre-loaded with the raw + prior markup (loaded as separate layer for further editing).
- [ ] Step 12.5.2: Save creates a new file (e.g. `<comment-id>-<timestamp>-marked-v2.png`); the comment's `attachments[]` updates to the new version; prior versions preserved in the journal.

### Task 12.6: Integration test + mobile verification

- [ ] Step 12.6.1: Tmp-fixture: capture a fixture screenshot; mark with each of the 5 tools; save; verify the marked file persists alongside raw; verify the comment renders both versions.
- [ ] Step 12.6.2: Touch-screen verification: run a Playwright test against an iPhone-class viewport; assert each tool works with touch input (no hover-only interaction).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Markup editor supports all five tools (arrow / box / freehand / text-label / blur-region) + undo / redo.
- [ ] Marked screenshot persists alongside the raw capture; comment annotation references both via `attachments[]` + `originalAttachment`.
- [ ] Re-mark workflow preserves prior markup versions in the journal.
- [ ] Touch-screen markup works without hover-only interactions.

## Closing milestone: scope-discovery v1 dogfood TF summary + audit handoff

**Deliverable:** Final TF entry in `tooling-feedback.md` summarizing the dogfood result (what worked / what didn't / what needs follow-up); closing comment on the feature PR linking the log; handoff to the scope-discovery team to import as `AUDIT-<date>-<NN>` entries in their audit log. Per PRD § Secondary deliverable.

### Task C.1: Aggregate TF entries + identify patterns

- [ ] Step C.1.1: Walk every TF-NNN entry in `tooling-feedback.md`; tabulate by category (A / AM / CL / GATE / DSC / MISC) + severity (high / medium / low).
- [ ] Step C.1.2: Identify recurring patterns — same root cause surfacing in multiple TF entries; promote those to GH issues if not already filed.
- [ ] Step C.1.3: Tabulate dispositions: how many TF entries closed by an in-flight fix during this feature vs how many remain open at feature-close.

### Task C.2: Write final TF summary

- [ ] Step C.2.1: Append the closure entry to `tooling-feedback.md` (next TF-NNN id) with title shape `TF-NNN · MISC · n/a · Dogfood closure summary`.
- [ ] Step C.2.2: Body: what worked (which protocol layers caught friction proactively); what didn't (which surfaces fell through to operator catch); what needs follow-up (recurring patterns justifying a v1.1 audit cycle).
- [ ] Step C.2.3: Include a one-line summary per still-open TF entry naming the gap; list closed TF entries with their closing-commit SHAs.

### Task C.3: Closing comment on the feature PR

- [ ] Step C.3.1: Comment on the graphical-entries PR linking `tooling-feedback.md` + naming the total TF count + how many promoted to GH issues.
- [ ] Step C.3.2: Tag the deskwork team for the audit-log import.

### Task C.4: Audit-log handoff

- [ ] Step C.4.1: The deskwork team imports the closure into `docs/1.0/001-IN-PROGRESS/scope-discovery/audit-log.md` as `AUDIT-<date>-<NN>` entries — mirror of how the audiocontrol pilot's TF-001..TF-016 imported into AUDIT-20260525-05..09.
- [ ] Step C.4.2: Each AUDIT entry references its source TF entry + summarizes the friction shape + the suggested fix.
- [ ] Step C.4.3: The aggregated audit-log entries become the v1.1 workplan input for scope-discovery.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] `tooling-feedback.md` carries a TF closure summary entry.
- [ ] The feature PR has a closing comment with TF count + promoted-issue count.
- [ ] The scope-discovery team has imported AUDIT entries derived from this feature's TF log.
