## 2026-04-29: dw-lifecycle Phase 3 — Doc tree + workplan I/O + setup

### Feature: dw-lifecycle
### Worktree: deskwork-dw-lifecycle

**Goal:** Land Phase 3 (T14–T19) of the `dw-lifecycle` plugin workplan: version-aware doc-tree resolution, workplan markdown parser/writer, ported `/feature-*` templates, and the `dw-lifecycle setup` subcommand that creates a branch + worktree + scaffolded docs from templates.

**Accomplished:**

- T14: `src/docs.ts` with `resolveFeatureDir` / `resolveFeaturePath` for version-aware path resolution. 5 tests, TDD.
- T15: `src/workplan.ts` with `parseWorkplan` + `markStepDone` plus fixture. Initial impl shipped at `68d3772`; code review caught two real issues (bold-step text not normalized, silent no-op on missing task/step) and a fix at `165a688` added `stripBold`, descriptive throws, and 5 regression tests.
- T16: 4 templates (`prd.md`, `workplan.md`, `readme.md`, `feature-definition.md`) under `plugins/dw-lifecycle/templates/`. Placeholder syntax `<word>`; substitutions for slug, title, targetVersion, date, branch, parentIssue. 110 lines total.
- T17: `src/subcommands/setup.ts` (138 lines) with branch + worktree creation, template rendering, optional definition append, JSON output. Initial impl at `c336b73`; review flagged shell-injection risk via `execSync` template literals, no rollback on partial-failure, and silent `--definition` skip. Fix at `4649812`: switched to `execFileSync` array form, try/catch with worktree+branch rollback, pre-flight throw on missing definition file, dynamic help text from `Object.keys(SUBCOMMANDS)`.
- T18: `src/__tests__/setup.smoke.test.ts` integration test. Handles the macOS `/var` → `/private/var` symlink case via `realpathSync`. Sets local `user.email`/`user.name` so the empty initial commit succeeds without host git config.
- T19: full vitest suite green (28/28, was 14/14 at session start), `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- 7 commits ahead of `8d959049` (T14, T15 + fix, T16, T17 + fix, T18) on `feature/deskwork-dw-lifecycle`.
- Used subagent-driven development per workplan instruction. Roughly 8 implementer dispatches and 4 reviewer dispatches across the phase. Reviewers caught 2 substantive bug clusters before they shipped (T15 bold/throw, T17 injection/rollback).

**Didn't Work (caught in review and fixed):**

- T15's verbatim-spec parser stored `**Step 1: foo**` (with asterisks) as `step.text` because the project's own workplan uses bold step bullets. Phase 4 callers passing `Step 1: foo` would have silently no-matched. Spec tests didn't cover bold input. Fix: `stripBold` helper applied symmetrically on parse and on `markStepDone` comparison; rewrite uses `line.replace('[ ]', '[x]')` to preserve the original bold formatting.
- T15's `markStepDone` returned source unchanged when the task or step didn't exist — a violation of CLAUDE.md's "throw, don't fall back" rule. The argument that "idempotency requires silent failure" conflated two distinct cases (already-done step vs missing target). Fix: track `taskFound`/`stepFound`, throw with descriptive errors on miss, stay silent only on already-done.
- T17's verbatim-spec used `execSync` with template-literal interpolation of `worktreePath` and `branchName`. A slug like `foo"; rm -rf /` would have terminated the quoted argument and injected. Fix: `execFileSync(cmd, args[])` array form bypasses the shell entirely.
- T17's verbatim-spec scaffolded files after creating the worktree with no rollback on failure. A disk-full or permissions error mid-scaffold left a half-built worktree the user had to clean up by hand. Fix: try/catch around post-worktree work; best-effort `git worktree remove --force` + `git branch -D` on error; error message includes manual cleanup instructions if rollback itself fails.
- T17's verbatim-spec silently skipped `--definition <path>` when the path didn't exist. Fix: pre-flight `existsSync(definitionFile)` throw before worktree creation.

**Course Corrections:**

- [PROCESS] When the implementer flags a deviation from verbatim spec citing an external constraint (here: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` rejecting `match[1]` direct access on T15), verify the constraint is real and the deviation is semantically equivalent before accepting. The spec reviewer here did this thoroughly — confirmed the regex capture groups are non-optional, so `match?.[N] !== undefined` reduces to the spec's `if (match)` predicate at runtime. Took ~5 minutes of analysis but produced confidence the deviation was zero behavioral drift.
- [PROCESS] Code reviewers worth their cost. On T15 and T17, the spec reviewer said ✅ but the code quality reviewer found real bugs that would have shipped. The marginal cost of the second pass (one extra subagent dispatch) caught 4 substantive issues across two tasks. The "save the second review for tasks with real logic" heuristic from prior session held up — both tasks had non-trivial logic (regex parsing, shell-out + file I/O), and both benefited.
- [COMPLEXITY] T16 templates were intentionally minimal (110 lines for 4 files). The risk in template-writing is gold-plating with prose that doesn't survive contact with real PRDs. Bracketed `[fill in here]` placeholders survive better than full prose drafts.

**Quantitative:**

- Messages from user: ~3 (proceed, session-end, plus implicit "continue" via auto mode)
- Commits: 7 implementation + 1 docs (this entry) = 8
- Files added/modified: 9 src files (docs.ts, workplan.ts, setup.ts, cli.ts modified, 4 templates, 1 smoke test) + 3 test files (docs.test, workplan.test, setup.smoke.test) + 1 fixture
- Tests: 14 → 28 passing (+14 net)
- Sub-agent dispatches: ~14 (4 implementers, 4 reviewers across spec/code, 2 fix implementers, 4 verification + cleanup)
- Corrections from user: 0 — user confirmed "proceed" once and let auto mode run; reviewer signals drove all course corrections
- Corrections caught by reviewers (mid-session, fixed before next task): 4 substantive (bold parse, throw-on-missing, shell injection, rollback) + minor cleanup (silent definition skip, stale help text)

**Insights:**

- The "spec test blind spots" memory from prior session paid off twice this session. T15's verbatim spec tests passed but missed both the bold-text round-trip case and the missing-target case. The reviewer prompt explicitly asked "what realistic call patterns aren't tested?" — the question itself drove the discoveries. Worth keeping that prompt language for future TDD reviews.
- The "verify reviewer-cited constraints" memory also paid off. The T15 implementer self-applied the discipline: hit `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, decided the spec couldn't compile as written, deviated minimally with semantic-equivalent guards, flagged DONE_WITH_CONCERNS so I could verify. That self-discipline is exactly what the memory was meant to encode.
- Auto mode worked well for this phase. The plan was well-specified, tasks were independent, and reviewer feedback could be acted on without checking back with the user. Two implementer follow-up dispatches (T15 fix, T17 fix) were the right call vs escalating.
- `Object.keys(SUBCOMMANDS).join(', ')` for the cli.ts help text is a small thing but it removes a class of stale-doc bugs forever. Worth adopting for similar registry-driven help text in future subcommands.

**Open follow-ups (not blockers):**

- `branchExists` only checks local refs (`refs/heads/`); a remote-only `origin/feature/<slug>` collision still creates a tracking branch. Not a bug per spec, but worth a one-line code comment documenting the scope.
- `import.meta.url` resolution for `TEMPLATES_DIR` works under tsx but would break if a `dist/` build is ever added. Add a comment noting the tsx assumption, or walk up to find the nearest `package.json` instead.
- `parentIssue: ''` in setup.ts renders as `Parent Issue: ` (empty trailing) in the README template. Could leave the literal `<parentIssue>` placeholder visible until `/dw-lifecycle:issues` fills it in. Punted — intent unclear, defer to Phase 5 when the issues subcommand exists.
- Phase 6 README rewrite still needs to document the peer-plugin relationship dropped from `plugin.json` last session.

**Next session:**

Phase 4 (T20–T26): journal append, `dw-lifecycle journal-append` subcommand, transitions (state moves between status dirs), `dw-lifecycle transition`, GitHub tracking helpers, `dw-lifecycle issues`. End state: every state-mutating subcommand exists.

## 2026-04-29: dw-lifecycle Phases 1–2 in one session

### Feature: dw-lifecycle
### Worktree: deskwork-dw-lifecycle

**Goal:** Start Phase 1 (plugin scaffolding) of the `dw-lifecycle` plugin per the workplan committed at `ab3d4cf`. The user said "continue" mid-flight, so the session ended up landing both Phase 1 (T1–T5 + 1 fix) and Phase 2 (T6–T13 + 1 fix) — plugin skeleton through bin foundation.

**Accomplished:**

- Phase 1: Plugin skeleton (`plugin.json`, `package.json`, `LICENSE`, `README` stub), TS + Vitest config, bin wrapper + cli stub, 15 SKILL.md stubs, marketplace registration. `claude plugin validate plugins/dw-lifecycle` passes (one benign `author` warning).
- Phase 2: Frontmatter helpers (parse / write / update with quote-style preservation via Symbol-attached YAML Document), Zod-based config schema with full-tree defaults, repo + git helpers, `dw-lifecycle install` and `dw-lifecycle doctor` subcommands, smoke test for install.
- 13 commits ahead of `ab3d4cf` on `feature/deskwork-dw-lifecycle`.
- 14 vitest tests pass: frontmatter (5), config (4), install.smoke (1), doctor (4). `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- End-to-end smoke: `dw-lifecycle install /tmp/<dir>` writes a default `.dw-lifecycle/config.json` matching the schema; `dw-lifecycle doctor /tmp/<dir>` reports peer-plugin and missing-config findings and exits non-zero on errors.
- Used subagent-driven development throughout: implementer → spec compliance reviewer → code quality reviewer per task. Ran ~24 sub-agent dispatches across 12 tasks.

**Didn't Work (caught in review and fixed):**

- Task 1's `plugin.json` shipped a `metadata.peerPlugins` block per the workplan spec. Code reviewer flagged it; I rejected the concern as "forward-design." Task 5's `claude plugin validate` then failed with "Unrecognized key: metadata." Had to ship a fix commit (`9f23804`) removing the block before Phase 1 was actually shippable. The reviewer was directionally right and I should have validated against the schema rather than trusting the spec verbatim.
- Task 6's first implementation passed all 4 spec tests but had a real bug: `updateFrontmatter` used `{ ...data, ...patch }`, and object spread does NOT copy non-enumerable Symbol-keyed properties. So the YAML Document attached for round-trip preservation was silently dropped, and the output fell back to plain `stringify` — stripping quote styles. The spec test for `updateFrontmatter` only patched unquoted scalars so the bug was invisible. Code reviewer caught it; fix added a 5th regression test that preserves `date: "2026-04-29"` through `updateFrontmatter`, then mutated the Document directly via `doc.set(key, value)` instead of spreading.

**Course Corrections:**

- [PROCESS] Reviewer feedback that contradicts the spec deserves verification, not summary rejection. Twice I dismissed reviewer concerns by citing "the spec says X verbatim" — once on the `metadata.peerPlugins` schema mismatch, once on a spread-vs-Symbol bug. Both were real. Going forward: when a reviewer cites an external constraint (schema validator, runtime behavior, language semantics), run the validator/test before deciding the spec wins.
- [PROCESS] Spec tests can have systematic blind spots. The Task 6 `updateFrontmatter` test mutated only unquoted scalars, missing the failure mode that mattered most for the module's purpose. When reviewing TDD-style spec tests, also ask "what realistic call would NOT exercise this test path?" and add a regression case for it before claiming the implementation is solid.
- [COMPLEXITY] The Task 6 round-trip preservation strategy (Symbol-attached YAML Document) is clever and works, but exports the Symbol type, which makes the implementation choice part of the public API. If real callers don't need Document access, this should be made module-private later. Flagged but not fixed in-session — the cost of refactoring outweighed the benefit while the API has no external callers.

**Quantitative:**

- Messages from user: ~7 (session-start, "confirm", "continue", "never mind. continue", session-end, plus mid-session marketplace install verification)
- Commits: 13 implementation + 1 docs (this entry) = 14
- Files added/modified: 28 (plugin.json + plugin tree, src/* TS files, src/__tests__/* test files, 15 SKILL.md stubs, marketplace.json, root package-lock.json)
- Tests: 0 → 14 passing
- Sub-agent dispatches: ~24 (implementer × 12, reviewer × ~12)
- Corrections from user: 0 — user delegated heavily; I caught the corrections via my own reviewer dispatches
- Corrections caught by reviewers (mid-session, fixed before commit on next task): 2 substantive (peerPlugins schema, frontmatter spread)

**Insights:**

- Two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality) caught bugs the spec tests didn't. The spec-only review on Task 6 said ✅ — the code quality reviewer found the spread bug. If I'd skipped the second stage, the bug would have shipped to Phase 5 (when subcommands like `setup` and `transition` start calling `updateFrontmatter` for real).
- Combining spec + code quality review into one prompt for trivial scaffolding tasks (Tasks 1, 4) saved a reviewer dispatch without obvious quality loss. For tasks with real logic (6, 7, 11) the two-stage form was worth the cost.
- "The spec is verbatim" is a heuristic, not a license to ignore reviewer signals. A spec written before contact with reality (the schema validator, the Symbol-spread interaction) embeds assumptions that may be wrong. Reviewer is testing those assumptions.
- The `subagent-driven-development` skill explicitly forbids skipping reviews. I tried to short-circuit on Task 4 (15 stub markdown files) and the skill held me back. The full review caught nothing, but the cost was small and the discipline mattered for the next task that DID have a real bug.

**Open follow-ups (not blockers):**

- Phase 6 README rewrite needs to document the peer-plugin relationship (`requires superpowers`, `recommends feature-dev`) since `metadata.peerPlugins` was dropped from `plugin.json`.
- The `YAML_DOC_SYM` and `FrontmatterData` exports in `frontmatter.ts` leak the round-trip implementation into the public API. Make module-private when no external callers exist (likely never — the symbol is internal-only).

**Next session:**

Phase 3 (T14–T19): Doc tree + workplan I/O. Version-aware path resolution (`docs/<v>/<status>/<slug>/`), markdown-table workplan parser/writer, and `dw-lifecycle setup` subcommand that creates the docs tree and populates PRD/workplan/README from templates.

## 2026-04-21: Phases 1–3 in one session

### Feature: deskwork-plugin
### Worktree: deskwork-plugin

**Goal:** Start Phase 1 (plugin skeleton + marketplace registration). The user then pushed through "continue" several times, so the session ended up landing Phases 1, 2, and 3 — skeleton, full adapter layer, and the four lifecycle skills (add, plan, draft, publish).

**Accomplished:**

- Phase 1: `plugins/deskwork/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugins/deskwork/README.md`, `skills/install/SKILL.md` skeleton, marketplace.json registering the plugin. Plugin validates and loads via `claude --plugin-dir`.
- Phase 2: Adapter layer at `plugins/deskwork/lib/{types,config,paths,frontmatter,calendar,calendar-mutations,scaffold,cli}.ts`. Config schema validates a host project's `.deskwork/config.json`. Calendar parser round-trips the live `audiocontrol.org/docs/editorial-calendar-audiocontrol.md` with no data loss (acceptance criterion verified). Install helper at `bin/deskwork-install.ts` validates config + seeds empty calendars.
- Phase 3: Four lifecycle helpers at `bin/deskwork-{add,plan,draft,publish}.ts` with matching SKILL.md files. Each skill pairs Claude-facing instructions with an argv-parsing bin helper that does the calendar mutation atomically and emits JSON. Blog scaffolder uses the frontmatter module + config (site blogLayout + top-level author).
- 6 commits on `feature/deskwork-plugin`; all ahead of main.
- 100 passing tests (unit + 21 integration tests that spawn the real bin scripts against tmp projects).
- Typecheck clean under TypeScript strict + `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.
- `claude plugin validate` passes for plugin and marketplace; `claude --plugin-dir` lists all 5 skills (install, add, plan, draft, publish).

**Didn't Work (fixed on first contact with reality):**

- Initial `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` included a `$schema` key. The Claude plugin validator rejects unknown top-level keys. Removed `$schema`; also moved marketplace `description` under `metadata.description` where the validator expects it.
- First cut of `bin/deskwork-install` used a `#!/usr/bin/env tsx` shebang on an **extensionless** file — tsx refused to treat it as TypeScript and Node choked on the type annotations. Renamed scripts to `deskwork-install.ts` etc. The plugin's `bin/` dir is still added to PATH, so invocation is by full filename.
- Library modules originally used `@/lib/X.ts` imports. That alias works under Vitest (configured in `vitest.config.ts`) and under `tsc` (via `paths` in `tsconfig.json`), but tsx at runtime doesn't resolve it — the `bin/` scripts that import from lib at runtime failed with `Cannot find package '@/lib'`. Switched all lib-internal imports to sibling-relative (`./types.ts`). Tests kept `@/lib/X.ts` for readability since vitest resolves it.
- Round-trip test for the calendar initially failed because `renderCalendar` groups entries by stage order (Ideas → Planned → ... → Published) — my fixture had Published first. Reordered the fixture to canonical stage order; the renderer's ordering is the correct invariant.
- Initial calendar port was 561 lines, over the 500-line file guideline. Split into `calendar.ts` (parse/render/I-O, 408 lines) and `calendar-mutations.ts` (137 lines) along a clean semantic boundary.

**Course Corrections:**

- [DOCUMENTATION] Workplan said "Create .claude-plugin/marketplace.json with **git-subdir** entry for deskwork." The correct pattern for a same-repo plugin is a **relative-path** source under `metadata.pluginRoot: "./plugins"` — `git-subdir` is for pointing at a plugin inside a *different* monorepo. Used relative path and noted the deviation in the workplan rather than following the instruction blindly.
- [COMPLEXITY] Did not split the calendar parser into three files (parse / render / I-O) as I initially considered. The two-file split was enough to satisfy the line-count guideline without inventing abstraction.
- [PROCESS] The `cd` into `plugins/deskwork` for vitest invocation persisted between Bash tool calls and caused a confusing "no such workspace" error later. Got comfortable passing absolute paths instead of relying on cwd.

**Quantitative:**

- Messages: ~7 from user (session-start, "do it", "continue" ×3, "I don't care", session-end)
- Commits: 6 feature commits + this journal commit
- Files created: 27 (lib: 8, bin: 5, test: 9, skills: 5 SKILL.md, plus package.json / tsconfig / vitest config)
- Tests: 0 → 100 passing
- Corrections from user: 0 — user delegated heavily with "continue" and "I don't care"; I flagged scope choices explicitly at each phase boundary and proceeded when approved

**Insights:**

- Running `claude plugin validate` is the fastest feedback loop for schema questions — I was about to WebFetch the docs to disambiguate `$schema` before realizing the validator would reject bad shapes with specific error messages in milliseconds.
- Integration tests that spawn the real `bin/` scripts via `child_process.spawnSync` caught three different classes of bug the unit tests wouldn't have (wrong cwd resolution, JSON output shape, exit codes for user-facing errors vs. bugs). Worth the extra ~7s of test time.
- The `@/` alias vs. runtime tsx tension is a real gotcha for Claude Code plugins that ship executables — documenting this in the workplan so future plugins in the monorepo know upfront.
- Splitting lifecycle work between "adapter in lib/" and "skill helpers in bin/" with a thin shared `cli.ts` kept each helper small (~100 lines) and uniform in shape. The UNIX-style composability claim in the plugin's README isn't just aspirational — the skills legitimately do one thing each.
- Extending the config schema mid-phase (adding `author` and `blogLayout` when the draft helper needed them) was clean because `parseConfig` is the single gatekeeper — add a field, add 4 tests, done.

**Next session:**

Phase 4 (dogfood) is manual validation work the user should drive: install the plugin in `~/work/audiocontrol.org`, run `/deskwork:install` to produce a real config, then add/plan/draft/publish against the live calendar and compare with the old `/editorial-*` skills. No new code until Phase 4 surfaces any gaps.
