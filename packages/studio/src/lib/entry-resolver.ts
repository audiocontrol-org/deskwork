/**
 * Resolve an entry uuid to its sidecar + on-disk artifact body. Studio
 * handlers use this when they need both metadata (from the sidecar) and
 * the live document content (from the markdown artifact on disk).
 *
 * Issue #222 (Option B + hybrid refinement) — `index.md` is always
 * "the document under review" for index.md-canonical entries. The
 * studio renders `index.md` regardless of `currentStage`. Per-stage
 * scrapbook files are frozen snapshots produced by `approveEntryStage`.
 *
 * Resolution (Phase 39d — sites→lanes retirement; STORED PATH ONLY):
 *   The sidecar's `artifactPath` is authoritative. There is NO
 *   `<contentDir>/<slug>/index.md` fallback — per the spec
 *   §"Resolution" and the project's "no fallbacks — throw" rule, an
 *   entry without a stored path THROWS a descriptive error pointing the
 *   operator at `deskwork doctor --fix` (the migration backfiller owns
 *   stamping it). Given a stored path, the resolver prefers
 *   `<dirname(artifactPath)>/index.md` when it exists on disk (T1's
 *   index.md-canonical case) and otherwise reads `artifactPath` itself
 *   (shared-directory layouts — e.g. deskwork's own feature-doc layout
 *   where prd.md / workplan.md / README.md share a directory). That is a
 *   read-side refinement OF a stored path, not a guess for an absent one.
 *
 * Pre-T1 the resolver routed by stage (Ideas → idea.md, Planned →
 * plan.md, Outlining → outline.md, Drafting/Final/Published →
 * index.md). That routing has been retired — see Issue #222.
