# Audit Log — feature/design-control

This document is the feature-local audit log for `feature/design-control`.

How to operate this log:

- Treat new or updated entries as actionable work, not bookkeeping.
- The audit log is the source of truth for current finding state.
- Never delete findings. Update entries in place under the same `Finding-ID`.
- `fixed-<sha>` means a fix landed; `verified-<date>` requires re-exercising the surface.
- If work is deferred, change `Status:` to `acknowledged-<ref>` with the issue, workplan section, or operator-approved plan.

Status quick-reference:

- `open` — reported; not yet resolved
- `acknowledged-<ref>` — accepted but deferred
- `fixed-<sha>` — fix landed, awaiting verification rerun
- `verified-<date>` — fix re-checked against the original surface
- `withdrawn-<date>` / `superseded-by-<finding-id>` — closed without deletion
- `informational` — observation only; no remediation required

Canonical grep queue:

- unfinished work: `grep -nE "^Status:[[:space:]]+(open|acknowledged|fixed-)" docs/1.0/001-IN-PROGRESS/design-control/audit-log.md`
- new findings: `grep -nE "^Status:[[:space:]]+open" docs/1.0/001-IN-PROGRESS/design-control/audit-log.md`
- awaiting verification: `grep -nE "^Status:[[:space:]]+fixed-" docs/1.0/001-IN-PROGRESS/design-control/audit-log.md`

## 2026-06-05 — audit-barrage lift (20260605T181608913Z-design-control)

### AUDIT-20260605-01 — EngineMethod union is hardcoded in three places with no compile-time link — silent drift on adding a method

Finding-ID: AUDIT-20260605-01 (claude-01 + claude-03 + claude-04 + codex-01 + codex-03; cross-model)
Status:     fixed-55e23a571aacbb3ebc78edf7bb58f5e1d3fd16e3
Severity:   medium
Surface:    plugins/design-control/src/engine-adapter/types.ts:24-27, conformance.ts:21-25, src/__tests__/engine-adapter/preflight.test.ts:9-13

Remediation (applied in working tree, pending commit; set Status to fixed-<sha> at commit time):
- 1a single-source method vocabulary: `ENGINE_METHODS` const added to types.ts; `EngineMethod` derived from it; `z.enum(ENGINE_METHODS)` in conformance.ts; preflight.test.ts loop iterates `ENGINE_METHODS` (hand-retyped `ALL_METHODS` removed). Tests: types.test.ts ENGINE_METHODS block.
- 1b compile-time method/envelope binding: `EngineAdapterRequestFor<M>`/`EngineAdapterResponseFor<M>` generics added; `EngineAdapter` interface methods bound to their own method; wide `EngineAdapterRequest`/`EngineAdapterResponse` kept as `…For<EngineMethod>` unions. Test: types.binding.test.ts (@ts-expect-error on mismatched method).
- 1c preflight remedy: interpolates the actual missing `adapterId`; names `frontend-design` only when the default adapter is the one missing. Tests: preflight.test.ts custom-engine + default-adapter remedy cases.
- 1d single-source [0,1] check: `ConfidenceSchema = z.number().refine(isConfidence, …)`; `validateConformance` calls `isConfidence`. Test: conformance.test.ts boundary-agreement table.
- 1e deferral language removed from types.ts/preflight.ts/index.ts comments; grep over engine-adapter/*.ts for deferral words returns zero hits.

`EngineMethod` is a type-only union (`'author-wireframe' | 'translate-design-language' | 'referee-screenshot'`) with no runtime const array. As a consequence the same three method strings are re-typed by hand in `EngineMethodSchema = z.enum([...])` (conformance.ts:21) and again in `ALL_METHODS` (preflight.test.ts:9). Nothing ties the zod enum back to the type — there is no `z.infer`/`satisfies` relationship. If a fourth method is added to the `EngineMethod` union, the zod request/response schemas will silently keep rejecting it and the conformance test loop will silently skip it, with **no TypeScript error**.

This is asymmetric with the sibling `FAILURE_MODES` (types.ts:42-49), which IS single-sourced as a `const [...] as const` array with both the `FailureMode` type and `FailureModeSchema = z.enum(FAILURE_MODES)` derived from it. The fix is to mirror that pattern exactly: declare `export const ENGINE_METHODS = ['author-wireframe', 'translate-design-language', 'referee-screenshot'] as const`, derive `EngineMethod` from it, and feed it to both `z.enum(ENGINE_METHODS)` and the test's `ALL_METHODS`. That collapses the drift surface from three to one. Given this is the *seam* the whole portability claim rests on, single-sourcing the method vocabulary is load-bearing, not cosmetic.

### AUDIT-20260605-02 — Manual-authoring test is tautological — asserts a string literal against itself, covers no implementation

Finding-ID: AUDIT-20260605-02 (claude-02 + codex-02; cross-model)
Status:     fixed-55e23a571aacbb3ebc78edf7bb58f5e1d3fd16e3
Severity:   medium
Surface:    plugins/design-control/src/__tests__/engine-adapter/preflight.test.ts:63-81

Remediation (applied in working tree, pending commit): the tautological placebo test was deleted. Replaced by conformance.test.ts § 'non-execution conformance surface requires no engine probe (AUDIT-02)', which exercises ENGINE_METHODS + confidence validators + the request/response zod schemas + validateConformance + parseAndValidate end-to-end with no probe constructed, and asserts an always-absent probe has zero effect on any non-execution operation. The test does not claim a manual-authoring helper exists; it covers only the engine-free property of today's code.

The test `'manual authoring path does not invoke the probe and requires no engine'` exercises nothing in the library. It builds `const manualAuthoringResult = (() => 'manual-wireframe-authored')()` and asserts that literal equals itself, then asserts a mock that the test never wired into any call site was never called. The comment is candid about this: *"modeled here by simply not calling preflightEngine."* That is the definition of a test that doesn't test the contract it claims to.

This matters because the manual-authoring-needs-no-engine invariant is the central scaffold claim in the PRD (*"scaffold completion does not require the engine"*) and the workplan acceptance criteria. A green checkmark here reads as "the invariant is verified" when in fact no manual-authoring code path exists in this diff to verify — the test is a placebo. Two honest options: (a) delete the test and let the invariant be covered by the Phase-2 integrated engine-absent witness the workplan already names, or (b) if a manual-authoring helper is meant to exist now, add it and have the test drive *it* with an absent-engine probe and assert it returns without touching the probe. Shipping a self-confirming test is worse than no test because it underwrites a false "verified" claim — the same failure mode the project's `ui-verification.md` § spec-compliance probes rule was written to prevent.

### AUDIT-20260605-03 — validateConformance trusts its typed inputs — no structural parse, and no combined parse-then-echo helper is exported

Finding-ID: AUDIT-20260605-03
Status:     fixed-55e23a571aacbb3ebc78edf7bb58f5e1d3fd16e3
Severity:   low
Surface:    plugins/design-control/src/engine-adapter/conformance.ts:78-141, index.ts:24-29

Remediation (applied in working tree, pending commit): `parseAndValidate(rawRequest: unknown, rawResponse: unknown): ConformanceResult` added to conformance.ts and exported from index.ts. It runs `EngineAdapterRequestSchema.safeParse` + `EngineAdapterResponseSchema.safeParse` first; on either failure it returns `conformant: false` with structural messages WITHOUT running the echo check; only when both parse does it call `validateConformance`. Tests: conformance.test.ts § parseAndValidate (malformed confidence, missing manifestId, non-echoing pair, conformant pair).

`validateConformance` takes `EngineAdapterRequest`/`EngineAdapterResponse` and performs only the semantic echo checks; it never runs `EngineAdapterRequestSchema`/`EngineAdapterResponseSchema`. That's a defensible split (structural vs semantic), but the public surface (index.ts) exports the two zod schemas and the echo-validator as three independent pieces with no guidance and no convenience wrapper that does parse-then-echo in the correct order. A real adapter caller — wiring untrusted engine output across a process boundary — can call `validateConformance` on a raw, unparsed object (TypeScript won't stop them if they `as` the boundary, and the engine output genuinely arrives `unknown`), getting a `conformant: true/false` verdict on a shape that was never structurally validated.

Per the project's fail-loud / no-bug-factory posture, the seam should make the safe path the easy path: export something like `parseAndValidate(rawRequest, rawResponse): ConformanceResult` that runs both schemas first (collecting structural violations) and only then runs the echo check, so a caller can't accidentally skip structural validation. As-is the ordering contract lives only in the doc-comment, which is the weakest place to enforce an invariant.

### AUDIT-20260605-04 — New plugin lands version 0.37.0 on a v0.36.0-based branch with no matching plugin.json in the diff

Finding-ID: AUDIT-20260605-04
Status:     informational
Severity:   informational
Surface:    plugins/design-control/package.json:3, package-lock.json (plugins/design-control entry)

`plugins/design-control/package.json` declares `"version": "0.37.0"` and the lockfile records the same, but the session journal states the branch is v0.36.0-based and 42 commits behind main. The project's lockstep rule (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`: *"The plugin shell's plugin.json version MUST equal the published npm package version"*) ties this number to a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` that is **not present in this diff** — the workplan places the plugin shell (plugin.json, bin shim, marketplace registration) in Phase 6, while this is Phase-1 work. So the version is being chosen before its lockstep counterpart exists, on a branch whose base version doesn't match it.

This is flagged as informational, not a bug: the package is `"private": true`, so it won't publish, and Phase-1 source legitimately lands in the plugin directory before the shell. But when the Phase-6 plugin.json is authored, whoever writes it must reconcile this 0.37.0 against the then-current release version (the branch is already behind main), or the lockstep invariant ships violated. Recording it here so the reconciliation isn't silently skipped at shell-creation time.
